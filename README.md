How to use github is something I would like to learn. Currently I just use the platform to store code and for version control. I just drag and drop my new code to the platform, but I am sure there is more to the Git and GitHub. The data scientists in our organizaation use it as a code repository for production python. Developing an indepth understanding is also something I could do on my own after graduation so no worrries if there is not time during the semester.
